    "# Data Loading & Preprocessing for Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a Deep Learning model using a very large dataset involves loading data into the memory (RAM) and preprocessing the data that includes type casting, scaling, augmenting. The problem is that the big data used for training Deep Learning models do not usually fit into the RAM. Thus, we need to dynamically read batches of data and preprocess.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An efficient tool for dynamic loading of data and preprocessing is **TensorFlow's Data API (tf.data)**. This API works with tf.keras. The tf.data API enables to build complex input pipelines to aggregate data from multiple files that are stored on disks, perform per-element transformations (e.g., normalization), data augmentations (e.g., resize, rotation, zoom, etc.), create batches of data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data API is able to read from text files (such as CSV files), binary files with fixed-size records (e.g., .mat files), and binary files that use TensorFlowâ€™s TFRecord format, which supports records of varying sizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tf.data introduces a **tf.data.Dataset** abstraction that represents a sequence of elements, in which each element consists of one or more components. For example, in an image pipeline, an element might be a single training example, with a pair of tensor components representing the image and its label. The Dataset is used for representing a very large set of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Object for Image Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical Deep Learning experiments, data is typically stored on disks. For example, in object recognition problems the image data is stored locally on the disk. First, we need to **construct** a Dataset object from the local image repository. Then, the Dataset object needs to be **transformed** to load image-label pairs. Prior loading we need to convert each encoded image (e.g., PNG, JPEG-encoded images) as a Tensor object, type-casting it (e.g., float32), scaling, getting the image label from the stored images (typically from the nested structure of the image directories). Finally, images have to put into batches for training the model. These stpes are described in a later notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we present Dataset techniques for loading and preprocessing a simple data artifact (i.e., a Python list). Specifically, we describe two steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructing a Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct a Dataset object from the data artifact in memory, we may use the following methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "- tf.data.Dataset.from_tensors(): constructs a Dataset with a single element, comprising the given tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(): constructs a Dataset whose elements are slices of the given tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- tf.data.Dataset.list_files(): constructs a Dataset from input files matching one or more glob patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if the input data is stored in a file in the recommended TFRecord format, we may use the tf.data.TFRecordDataset() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transforming a Dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a Dataset object, we can transform it into a new Dataset by chaining method calls on the Dataset object. There are generally two types of transformations that we can apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Per-element transformation: using the map() method (e.g., for loading data as image tensor and label pairs, scaling, augmentation, etc.)\n",
    "- Multi-element transformation: using the batch() method\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these two methods, following methods are used for preprocessing or preparing the dataset for training: cache(), shuffle(), repeat(), prefetch(), interleave()\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we describe these methods briefly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- cache(filename)\n",
    "\n",
    "It stores the elements in the Dataset, which is useful for future reuse. The first time the Dataset is iterated over, its elements will be cached either in the specified file or in memory (default behavior). Subsequent iterations will use the cached Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a small enough dataset, the cache method makes the training extra fast because the data is saved in memory after the first epoch. For larger datasets, it may be possible to cache the data to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- map(map_func, num_parallel_calls=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "It applies the given transformation function \"map_func\" to the input Dataset. We can parallelize this process by setting the \"num_parallel_calls\" parameter. For example, we may set the \"num_parallel_calls\" to the number of threads/processes that can be used for transformation. Alternatively, we may use the value tf.data.AUTOTUNE, which dynamically sets the number of parallel calls based on available CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- shuffle(buffer_size, seed=None, reshuffle_each_iteration=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "The shuffle method randomly shuffles the elements of the Dataset. It fills a buffer with buffer_size elements, then randomly samples elements from the buffer, replacing the selected elements with new elements. For perfect shuffling, a buffer_size greater than or equal to the full size of the Dataset is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if the Dataset contains 10,000 elements but buffer_size is set to 1,000, then shuffle will initially select a random element from only the first 1,000 elements in the buffer. Once an element is selected, its space in the buffer is replaced by the next (i.e. 1,001-st) element, maintaining the 1,000 element buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the \"reshuffle_each_iteration\" argument is set to None. As a consequence, when batching is performed, the Dataset will produce different batches during each epoch. For producing same batches, its value should beset to False.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- repeat(count) \n",
    "\n",
    "It is used to repeat the Dataset \"count\" number of times. It is useful in scenarios when data ends up but the training should be continued. If repeat is set, then it starts reading the Dataset from the very beginning. The \"count\" argument should be set equal to the value of the number of epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- batch(batch_size, drop_remainder=False, num_parallel_calls=None) \n",
    "\n",
    "It splits the Dataset into subset of the given batch_size. By setting the \"drop_remainder\" to True, emitting batches of exactly same size can be guaranteed. It does so by removing enough training examples such that the size of the training set is divisible by the batch_size. Also, this process can be parallelized by using \"num_parallel_calls\". Typically, we set it to tf.data.AUTOTUNE, which will prompt the tf.data runtime to tune the value dynamically at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- prefetch(buffer_size) \n",
    "\n",
    "It creates a Dataset that prefetches elements from the given Dataset. It is used to prefetch a batch to decouple the time when data is produced from the time when data is consumed. The transformation uses a background thread and an internal buffer to prefetch elements from the input Dataset ahead of the time they are requested. \n",
    "This often improves latency and throughput, at the cost of using additional memory to store prefetched elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of elements to prefetch should be equal to (or possibly greater than) the number of batches consumed by a single training epoch. Instead of manually tuning this value, we set it to tf.data.AUTOTUNE, \n",
    "which will prompt the tf.data runtime to tune the value dynamically at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- interleave(map_func, cycle_length=None, block_length=None, num_parallel_calls=None) \n",
    "\n",
    "It reads data from different files and parallelize this process. It applies the \"map_func\" function across the Dataset, and interleaves the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cycle_length and block_length arguments control the order in which elements are produced. cycle_length controls the number of input elements that are processed concurrently. In general, this transformation will apply map_func to cycle_length input elements, open iterators on the returned Dataset objects, and cycle through them producing block_length consecutive elements from each iterator, and consuming the next input element each time it reaches the end of an iterator.\n"
